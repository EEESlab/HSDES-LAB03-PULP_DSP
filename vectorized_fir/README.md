# FIR Filter 

This example demonstrates how to use vectorial insttruction on low-precision FIR filters. 
The _test.c_ file includes the implementaion of the FIR filter using multiple datatypes (_int32_, _int16_, _int8_). 
The latency performance are measured and reported. 

## Getting Started
To get started with the example, simply:
~~~~~shell
cd vectorized_fir/
make clean all run
~~~~~
