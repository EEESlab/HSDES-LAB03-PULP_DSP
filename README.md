# HSDES-LAB03: Digital Signal Processing Programming on PULP

The goals of this lab session are:
1) SIMD Vectorized FIR Filters
2) Loop Unrolling tecnquiques for Matrix Multiplications
3) SIMD Vectorized MatMul (on your own)
4) Convolution on PULP

A final assignment is described [here](https://github.com/EEESlab/HSDES-LAB03-PULP_DSP/blob/master/lab_assignment/README.md)


## Getting Started
Open a shell and clone the repository with the sample code. 
Remember also to source the PULP-SDK configuration script. 
~~~~~shell
source /pulp/sourceme.sh
cd <working_dir>
git clone https://github.com/EEESlab/HSDES-LAB03-PULP_DSP
~~~~~
